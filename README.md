### About this project

this is a simple leaderboard project that gets 100 posts from ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts``` and groups them by users to display an leaderboard. You can create an fake account with an user id from 1 to 10 and a fake password with at least 6 characters. After logging you will be redirected to the panel section where you can see your panel and crete new posts.Since the jsonplaceholder api isnt a real api with auth and real data, after the first initial load of the posts everything gets handled by the vue state from login to new posts and leaderboard.
